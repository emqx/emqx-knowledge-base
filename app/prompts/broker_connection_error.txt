## EMQX Broker Connection Error

I was unable to connect to your EMQX broker. This could be due to:
- Incorrect broker address or credentials
- The broker is not running or not accessible from this location
- Network connectivity issues or firewall restrictions

Please verify your broker details and try again. You can still receive assistance based on available knowledge base information.
