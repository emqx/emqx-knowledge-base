# EMQX Knowledge Base Slack Bot

A Slack bot that collects problems and solutions from Slack threads and responds to user questions using OpenAI and vector embeddings.

## Features

- **Knowledge Collection**: Users can explicitly request to save valuable Slack threads to the knowledge base
- **Thread Analysis**: Analyze ongoing threads to provide assistance without saving them
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions and get responses based on the collected knowledge
- **Vector Search**: Uses PostgreSQL with pg_vector for efficient similarity search
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's Response API for generating high-quality answers
- **Documentation Awareness**: References official EMQX documentation when appropriate
